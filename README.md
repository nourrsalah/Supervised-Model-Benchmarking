## 📌 Overview
This project compares multiple supervised learning algorithms on a classification dataset.  
The goal is to evaluate trade-offs between **accuracy, precision, recall, and interpretability** to select the best-performing model.  
The approach can be applied to **predicting education outcomes** or **health risks** in real-world programs.
